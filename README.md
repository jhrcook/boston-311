# Boston's 311 Service API

I recently made a request to have some graffiti removed by the city of Boston and used their 311 service for reporting non-emergency crimes.
I found it an interesting service and  decided to look closer into it.
They provide an free API for the service, so I decided to make this Python package to interface with the API.
