# Boston's 311 Service API

I recently made a request to have some graffiti removed by the city of Boston and used their 311 service for reporting non-emergency crimes.
I found it an interesting service and have decided to look closer into it, particularly if I can make something useful of the API.
Currently, I am just experimenting with the API in [`api-exploration.py`](api-exploration.py), but will eventually turn this into something more useful.
At the moment, it seems like this will be a good option for my first Python package; I don't see anything on PyPi yet.
